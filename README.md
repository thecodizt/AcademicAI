Navigating the Academic Labyrinth with AI

### Introduction
Welcome to AcademicAI, a data analytics project designed to make the process of gathering reliable data from university websites easier and more efficient. This project was born out of the need to reduce the time spent navigating through various official university sites for information. 

AcademicAI uses web scraping techniques to extract data from these websites and employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the obtained text data. The results are then presented in an interactive dashboard, providing users with a comprehensive and user-friendly platform to explore the data.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance and expand the capabilities of AcademicAI.
